# Legacy_Login

**FiveM project developed in September 2023.**

## 📝 Description

This script was created back in 2023 while I was active in the FiveM development scene. Since I've now officially quit FiveM, I decided to publish some of my old projects — especially the ones I built for free, which I believe should be free of major issues.

A lot of my scripts have just been sitting unused on my PC, and there's really no point in keeping them private anymore. This one seemed worth sharing — it might help someone starting a new server or just looking for a solid base.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
I haven't tested this script recently, so I can't guarantee full compatibility with the latest versions of FiveM or related resources.
